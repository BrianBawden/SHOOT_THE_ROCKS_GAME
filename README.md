# Overview

I wanted to do something fun and practice coding by creating a game. I decided to create a space shooting game using Python and arcade with VS Code. I wanted to get practice using arcade documentation to help me build my project. I would have to say this project has helped me learn to read and use documentation a lot. There were several times in the beginning that I used YouTube and followed along to help solve problems, but towards the end I was referencing the documentation any time I got stuck. 

This game the player is a space ship that has to shoot or dodge the falling meteors. If a meteor is shoot by a laser the player earns a point. Every ten points the player advances to the next level. At each level the background color changes randomly and the new meteors created start to fall faster. The point of the game is to survive and see how high of a score you can get. If the ship is hit by a meteor the game restarts.
